## Why a clickgen?

xcursorgen and anicursorgen.py both are non-standardized CLI tools for building cursor. It means you need both tools for creating a cross-platform compilable cursor theme. Both tools lacking some key functionality, When you want to create a **fully-functional** cursor/s.

**Missing functionality in `xcursorgen` & `anicursorgen.py` :**

- Require _config file_ to built **XCursor**/**CUR**/**ANI**
- Missing _packaging_ compatibility
- We've to interact through CLI.
